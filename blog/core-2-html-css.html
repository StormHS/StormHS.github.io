    <h1>The Learning Plan - Core Blog 2</h1> 
    <h3>My long-term goal and career pathway</h3>
        <p class="justify">The ideal long-term plan for my career would include working as a software engineer and potentially doing 1 or 2 days a week as a primary school social worker or guidance counsellor. I think balancing problem-solving and tec with social service work would be the perfect balance to fill my cup. I would also love to have the option to work remotely for a few months a year and travel to visit family overseas.</p> 
      
    <h3>My strengths and limitations with learning</h3>
      
    <h4>Strengths üí™üèΩ:</h4>
      <p class="justify">Planning and time management are really helpful for my learning and growth, because of this I have lots of methods of productivity and planning in place. 
        <br></br>
        Teamwork, I really thrive putting in and gaining energy from working in a team. I love the dynamics and possibilities in groups.</p> 
    <h4>Limitations ü§ï</h4>
    <p class="justify">Sometimes I struggle to understand long written instructions or explanations. If these come up I will still be able to achieve the outcome but it may be slower and more of a struggle. </p>
    <h3>My core skills to develop at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p class="justify">Confidence in asking questions and my abilities. I know I am able to do this but I can sometimes feel not smart enough to do so. It will be important for me to keep checking in and tracking my own growth and learning, rather than comparing it to the abilities of others.</p>  
      
    <h3>Productivity</h3>
    <p class="justify">I have lots of productivity support platforms in place. Some of these include</p> 
        <ul class="justify"> 
          <li>Obsidian - I use for all my daily notes and notes on classwork</li>
          <li>Google Tasks - Do daily to-do lists </li>
          <li>Toggl - to track my time.</li> 
          <li>Google Calander - to plan my time</li>
        </ul>
     <h3>Seeking help in a timely way</h3>
     <p class="justify">I know 4 people who have completed the course. I will speak to them if I get stuck as well as reach out to people in my cohort.  </p>
      
      <h3>What I expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p class="justify">Mainly availability for support if needed. Doesn't have to be straight away, just within a reasonable amount of time.</p>
      
      <h3>Schedualling issues?</h3>
      <p class="justify">Should be no worries! </p>
