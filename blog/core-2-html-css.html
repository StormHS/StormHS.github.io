    <h1>The Learning Plan</h1> 
    <h4>April 2023</h4>
    <h3>My long-term goal and career pathway</h3>
        <p class="justify">The ideal for me would be a balance of coding and social services studies work. I would love to be able to work remotley and travel, challenging my brain doing coding mahi and visiting family/going on adventures. However while travelling I would like to be able to pick up voulenteering work orverseas; like primary teaching, guidance counselling or helping in food banks etc. </p> 
      
    <h3>My strengths and limitations with learning</h3>
      
    <h4>Strengths üí™üèΩ & Limitations üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è:</h4>
      <p class="justify">I think i'm quite positive in team dynamics and really love to notice the skills that individual people bring to teams and encourage and affirm that. Limitations may be the intensity of the learning every single day, not being able to take micro breaks to have a breather as often as would be ideal and frustration with myself when I am struggling. </p>
    <h3>Productivity</h3>
      <p class="justify">I have lots of productivity support platforms in place. Some of these include</p> 
        <ul class="justify"> 
          <li>Obsidian - I use for all my daily notes and notes on classwork</li>
          <li>Google Tasks - Do daily to-do lists </li>
          <li>Toggl - to track my time.</li> 
          <li>Google Calander - to plan my time</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Seeking help in a timely way</h3>
      <p class="justify">I know 4 people who have completed the course. I will speak to them if I get stuck as well as reach out to people in my cohort.  </p>
    
      <h3>What non-tec skills do you want to develop?</h3>
      <p class="justify">Self-reflection and self-awareness is something I always want to work on and bootcamp will give me plenty of challenges and growth oppertunities to reflect on! I love teamwork and am keen to keep developing those skills as well. </p>
    <h3>What I expect from the Bootcamp team</h3>
      <p class="justify">I think just being available for support if needed. Biggest one is probably explaining things in a range of ways that fit a range of learning styles. It would make a huge difference if the learning and steps where broken down into metaphors and simple explanations. </p>
      
    <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
    <p class="justify">To finish it! To make the most of the oppertunity to study. Its long but also really short and I want to be present and engage and gain as much as I can from the learning and environment. </p>
