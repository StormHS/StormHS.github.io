    <h1>Core Studies Reflection</h1>
      <h4>25th April 2023</h4>

  <h3>
    What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?  </h3>
   <p class="justify">
    <ul class="justify"> 
      <li>I felt like it was kind of confronting putting my reflections on a public platform. That contributed to why I didn't want to go as deep on the blog.</li>
      <li>I found that I genuinley enjoy the challenge of learning to code! I obviously hoped that would be the case but have really found I do.</li>
      <li>It's not that I thought they wouldn't be but I have really enjoyed and valued how lovely and kind the other devs have been. Its made a huge difference so far having such lovely team mates.</li> 
    </ul>
   </p>
  <h3>
    What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?  </h3>
    <p class="justify">It can be such a frustrating but also incredibly satisfying thing to learn. I found it triggered up a bit of old frustration for being in school and not understanding the questions or feeling not smart enough to. The gained self awareness since then has helped me heaps to bounce back from the frustration and not want to just quit for fear of not being smart enough. </p>
  <h3>
    What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
    <p class="justify">What really suprised me about doing the core stuff is how, though it's my usual favourite topic and all my work expereience so far (neuroplasticity, psyc, human relationships etc), I just couldn't really let myself dive as deep while I had so much coding to learn! Though I found in my spare time, as per usual, I was still researching this stuff. I also found that I got stumped having to share personal reflections on the blog.</p>
  <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
    <p class="justify">Probably the privacy thing. I found that due to not wanting to share private reflection on a public platform I didn't go as deeply into the public reflections as I could have. However I still reflected in more depth privately. </p>
  <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
    <p class="justify">I have found it is easier to just really want and honestly really need to deep dive into the code learning. Learning the code is so dense and complex. I can imagine that without a human study element it could be easy to miss the core skills side of things and just deep dive into the coding, because it's so engaging. However learning to reflect on yourself and how you work in a team I can imagine is also super important for pair programming and  seeing vision and direction within an organisation when you find work. </p>
  <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
    <p class="justify">No, though I've said I really want to just focus on the code as thats the new thing and the human studies is my background, I think it's really valuable. To also sound like a contradiction to what I have said above I think taking the intentional time to reflect along the way so far is invaluable to letting the learning integrate and getting a chance to look up and see the bigger picture. </p>
