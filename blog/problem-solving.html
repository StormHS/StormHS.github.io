    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
    <h4>21st April 2023</h4>
    <h3>When were you blocked on a simple problem?</h3>
    <p class="justify">I had a problem where I had to call a functino I had written in the question above. However I dind't know what that meant - to 'call' a function. So I just re-wrote the entire function under my other new function. This failed the NPM test. I tried googling and then messaged a peer to talk it thorugh with me. He was super helpful and I actually ended it figuring it out just because he was there to talk to. I really appreciated it! I think i'm learning to get slightly better with the feeling of frustration. The feeling of satisfaction when you get a test right is fantastic! Through this I learned how to call in the function for this particular question. </p>
    <h3>And another?</h3>
    <p class="justify">I didn't know how to use the .find() method so I used google and online learning platforms like Scrimba. I found that I enjoyed this particular problem. I found the Scrimba's  '.find tutorial ' incredibly useful and I have also been using Scrimba to console.log and test my code! What i have learned from this was the general gist of how methods work and more specifically what .find() is about. </p>
    <h3>How confident are you one these problem solving methods?</h3>
    <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
    <p class="justify">I'm not sure I completely understand Pseudocode yet! However the practise of writing out the steps you want code to follow and breaking a problem down step by step is very helpful! </p>
    <h4>Trying something</h4>
    <p class="justify">Writing and testing code in online platforms where I can console.log has been super helpful! I have had the chance to play around with and try different approaches. This gave me insight into how each step of the code works and what is static and what can be changed. </p>
    <h4>Rubber Ducky Method</h4>
    <p class="justify">I feel like I am the rubber duck most of the time... however pairing up and learning from/teaching other people who have similar understanding levels as me was super helpful. Explaining it to myself, other people or a 'rubber duck', really helps the information to sink in.</p>
    <h4>Reading Error Messages</h4>
    <p class="justify">I honestly haven't spent enough time reading error messages in the terminal. This is something I want to do more. I can get into the habbit of just paying around till it works. Reading the error messages in VSCode however are very helpful. The red squiggly line has corrected me multiple times. </p>
    <h4>Console.logging</h4>
    <p class="justify">LOVE this. Console.logging is my absolute favourite way to test if what i'm doing is right. It is the difference between knowing what you're creating and just fumbling round in the dark.</p>
    <h4>Googling</h4>
    <p class="justify">Google is epic! It's becoming a coding best friend! </p>
    <h4>Asking for help from peers</h4>
    <p class="justify">Ever better best friend! I can't say enough how much I appreciate the help my peers have given so far!</p>
    <h4>Asking for help from coaches</h4>
    <p class="justify">I haven't done this so much yet! But will keep the option in mind! Going to the live sessions and asking questions in there has been very useful!</p>
    <h4>Improving proccess through reflection</h4>
    <p class="justify">This comes through when doing peer programming. Gives the chance to reflect with someone on how we're going, whats hard and strengths!</p>
    <h3>Reflection on a time you were reluctant to ask for help?</h3>
    <p class="justify">
      I often find once I've had help I set myself a made up window of not being allowed to ask for help again. I think worrying that it will mean I can't do 'anything' by myself. However the more I ask for help, the more I learn and the more likely I am to be able to do things by myself.</p>
