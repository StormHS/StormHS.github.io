  <h3>
    Neuroplasticity
  </h3>
   <p class="justify">
    Imagination and action both have an impact in a similar way on your brain. For example, imagining a sunflower activates the part of the brain in the same way that seeing a sunflower does. Our brains are changeable and grow, they are not static. Repetition and practice also strengthen neural networks and pathways and through this, you are able to change your abilities and the function of your brain. There have been studies that found that even knowing your brain can change, flex and grow can increase your success in learning. It's ironically the case that if you know you can learn and that your brain is malleable then your brain changes to make you more able of learning and it grows and grows from there. On the contrary, if you think your brain is static, then you set yourself up to have your brain act in that way.

  <h3>
    Growth Mindset
  </h3>
    <p class="justify">
      Linked to this concept of neuroplastic is that of a growth mindset. To continue from before, if you continue to tell yourself you are unable to learn or not smart enough, or organised enough or allow yourself to doubt your ability to achieve then this is created in your reality. A growth mindset flips this on your head. If you perceive struggle as the key to advancement then so this will be the case. Talk kindly and encouragingly to your self and you will be encouraged. Talk discouragingly or billitlingly to yourself and you will believe yourself to be those things, as will your brain.

  <h3>
    Application
  </h3>
    <p class="justify">
      Personally, I find it very useful to revisit study around neuroplasticity and a growth mindset. It is a helpful reminder that when I tell myself Dev is too hard or I am not smart enough, I am only making that my reality and setting myself up to fail. However, if encourage myself and remind myself struggle is the key to growth, then it's not such an uphill push.
