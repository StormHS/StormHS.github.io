    <h1>Javascript and DOM</h1>
    <h4>15 April 2023</h4>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p class="justify"> Javascript.... Is quite hard work. I can't say I have my head around it in any way, but lets try explain some of the concepts.</p>
   <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
   <p class="justify"> Control flow is the order of the flow of things being executed in the program. Imagine you have a fast-flowing river and you chuck in a stick then a kayak and o and on with random things. The control flow controls what comes out and over the waterfall first. Loops are a block of code that runs around I loops. You decide the specific parameters of this. Think of it like a round conveyor belt. you put all the items in the control flow order and then decide how many times you want them to go around in a loop. 
    </p>
   <h3>What's the DOM</h3>
   <p class="justify">DOM stands for Document Object Model (DOM). This allows you to manipulate the elements and code in a page on the web through the inspect command. You can mess around with anything in there and it can also help you locate a particular part of code if you want that!</p>
   <h3>Arrays and Objects</h3>
   <p class="justify">Arrays are a list of data items. They are counted numerically from 0 + (programmers always count from 0 üòâ) You can access these by identifying the number in the array you want to pull out.
    <br></br>
    Objects are like a case for a list of information. Say you have a website where you want to have someones name, age, number, address listed. An object would store these inside {}.</p>
   <h3>Functions</h3>
   <p class="justify">A function is an action you want to create For example you could create a funciton that changed the color inside a dot from green to blue by double clicking it. </p>
