Emotional intelligence (EQ) is being able to understand not only the emotions of people around you but have an in-depth understanding of your own emotions, triggers and actions relating to both. 
<br></br>
IQ is the ability or measure of intelligence in the class book smart sense. Are you able to take on and learn new information? How so do you do that and to what degree are you able to do so? IQ is controversial and doesn't historically account for the ranges in book smart intelligence or for different learning styles and what it means to be smart. 
<br></br>
A comparison of IQ and EQ may be the smarts of your mind and the smarts of your feeling heart.
<br></br>
Emotional intelligence is key to having a society that understands themselves and their actions. without emotional intelligence, people may trigger others, become triggered themselves and then from there have no deeper understanding of why the action and trigger happened in the first place. A way to develop EQ is mindfulness. This may include daily meditation or engaging in activities like therapy. This furthers the dialogue you have with your emotional self and what is causing you to act and feel as you do.
