    <h1>Ethics, Strengths and Values</h1> 
    <h4>April 2023</h4>
    <h3>An Ethical Dilemma üí°</h3>
        <p class="justify">In my time as a social worker, lots of ethical decisions came up. One example was when a young person was arrested and went to jail. They had a pet at home and no one to call to feed that pet. They asked one of the managers in my team to break into their home and feed their pet otherwise they would have no access to food. The SPCA wasn't taking calls. I had to make the decision with the manager to not to go to the house and feed the pet. The young person eventually found someone else. Ethically it's not within the roles or capacity to feed someone's pet and go to their home, let alone break in to get there. However, it was a hard call knowing the pet was without food for over a day. I would still make the same decision. Boundaries were very important in my role as the manager of a youth support NGO. There is only so much people can do and in this situation, it was beyond the scope of that. </p> 
      
    <h3>The People Around Me ü•∞</h3>
      <p class="justify"> I have some very special and loving friends and family. They are genuine, reflective and fun and I'm very grateful and inspired by them!</p> 
    <h3>My Strengths üí™üèΩ</h3>
    <p>Last year I completed the Clifton Strengths assessment. These were some of my top strengths.</p>
        <ul class="justify"> 
          <li>Individualisation is about being able and enjoying figuring people on an individual level and identifying how their strengths and skills can work together well in a team. I am excited for the team projects at Dev and for learning and working in a team but am also loving working independently to get the basics of coding before beginning the team projects. I thrive in a supportive, engaged and inspired team environment and love to contribute to that energy.</li>
          <li>Empathy</li>
          <li>Adaptability is about thriving in the now and enjoying walking the natural path that mahi and life take. I do well responding to situations as they come up and adapting to that environment. I like to develop and learn how to better be in touch with my gut response and trust that. </li> 
          <li>Developer - This is about noticing the small growth moments and really recognising them. I get inspired by personal growth and development, not just in myself but also in the people I am working with!</li>
          <li>Positivity</li>
        </ul>
     <h3>Limitations ü§ï</h3>
     <p class="justify">    Growing up with dyslexia and not knowing sometimes meant I struggled with feeling incapable of some things or not smart enough. If that feeling popped up and I thought I wasn't clever enough to do something, sometimes I didn't even try because I thought I'd fail. This is no longer a limitation, I am excited about a challenge and love the growth mindset approach of struggle not being proof you can't do something but being *part* of doing anything. What may affect my learning journey with this is I now push myself quite hard and can find it hard to see the line of whats enough and allow myself to relax and not feel the pressure to learn or grow.</p>
      <h3>Ever worked in a team and had tension?</h3>
      <p class="justify">	In a prior job, there were lots of heavy things that happened all at once, this meant I had to re-prioritise my time and couldn't be as attentive to some things and the people in the team's needs as I would've liked. The strategy I implemented was regular group catchups and sharing responsibilities so everyone's needs could be met and we could contribute to that collectively. On reflection, I probably would have done that sooner than I did. It was really helpful.</p>
